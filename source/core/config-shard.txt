A sharded cluster must have a config server, but it can be either a 
config shard or a dedicated config server. Using a config shard reduces 
the number of nodes required and can simplify your deployment. A config 
shard cluster is also called an embedded config server cluster. You 
cannot use the same config server for multiple sharded clusters.

Use Cases
---------

.. include:: /includes/config-shard-use-cases.rst

Behavior
--------

In an embedded config server cluster, a config shard will be used to 
store cluster metadata and user data. It helps reduce the complexity of 
a sharded cluster deployment. 

You can store sharded and unsharded collection data in your config 
shard. It has all the properties of a shard as well as acting as the 
config server.
