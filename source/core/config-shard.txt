Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can configure a config server to store your 
application data in addition to the usual sharded cluster metadata. A 
:binary:`mongod` node that provides both config server and shard server 
functionality is called a config shard. A ``mongod`` node that runs as a 
standalone :option:`--configsvr` without shard server functionality 
is called a dedicated :ref:`config server 
<sharded-cluster-config-server>`.

A sharded cluster must have a config server, but it can be either a 
config shard or a dedicated config server. Using a config shard reduces 
the number of nodes required and can simplify your deployment. A config 
shard cluster is also called an embedded config server cluster. You 
cannot use the same config server for multiple sharded clusters.

Use Cases
---------

You can consider using a config shard if your cluster has three or fewer 
shards.

If your application has demanding availability and resiliency 
requirements, consider deploying a dedicated config server. A dedicated 
config server provides isolation, dedicated resources, and consistent 
performance for critical cluster operations.

You should use a dedicated config server if you satisfy one or more of 
the following conditions:

- You plan to :ref:`add <sharding-procedure-add-shard>` and :ref:`remove 
  shards <remove-shards-from-cluster-tutorial>` rapidly.
- You plan to use :ref:`Time series collections 
  <manual-timeseries-landing>` or :ref:`Queryable Encryption 
  <qe-manual-feature-qe>` collections. 
- You use :opsmgr:`queryable backups </tutorial/query-backup>` (on-prem).


Behavior
--------

In an embedded config server cluster, a config shard will be used to 
store cluster metadata and user data. It helps reduce the complexity of 
a sharded cluster deployment. 

You can store sharded and unsharded collection data in your config 
shard. It has all the properties of a shard as well as acting as the 
config server.
